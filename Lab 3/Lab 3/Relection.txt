1.What did you learn? What did you know already?

All extercises in these lab were new to me. i have some idea apoint pointer and vector but the only programming course i took is in python.
so it was new to me. i have learnt how to pass to function and change its value in that scope. and i also learnt that it is much easy to deal
with the vector that with the array.

2.What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?

there is much correlation with lab 3 so it was easy to connect, but i had struggle a bit on double pointer. however i reviewed the lecture and watch
some youtube videos to overcome it.

3.How can the lab be improved?
i like the lab question, so no improvement feedback for now.

4.Additionally, write an estimate how many hours you spent on this lab.

Approxiametly 10 hours. however, i included the tile i spent to study the material.
